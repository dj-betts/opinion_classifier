not be higher of s critics like of the chairman of the and s director of national intelligence go further than saying that the put a thumb on the scale for have suggested that the extra boost was decisive that would not have been elected in 2016 but for interference crucial legacy of 2016 is that the question of s legitimacy was never settled without any consensus on what happened in 2016 the rules of the road for 2020 are up in the air first armed with the powers of law enforcement and presidential access to classified material is getting ready to roll out his account of 2016 promises he most likely has in mind the ongoing investigation by and its long-expected report although it is also possible that s public work product will take the form of indictments or perhaps nothing at all who assigned the task of investigating the probe in last year and met with him several times immediately after the conclusion of s investigation is overseeing s work and briefs on his findings regularly on s public statements we can see the rough contours of s findings beginning to take shape government s conduct during the transition has said was of s campaign amounted to there was the all-important question of whether the was justified in opening the initial investigation into the campaign s ties ordinary circumstances prosecutors do not comment on anything connected to an ongoing investigation but on the day that released his report both and decided to do just that s interest in said was based and said in his own statement had found that the investigation was justified so these sounded like sweeping words of dissent over the coming months as attention drifted elsewhere they shrank the time sat down with the only dispute with he d voiced was whether the had enough evidence to open a full investigation and believe that there was only enough to open a preliminary investigation not a full one our first interview mentioned the dossier of salacious anti-Trump claims that had been gathered and circulated by a former intelligence agent who was working indirectly for the campaign possibility that the government intentionally seeded the dossier with misinformation was one of the issues ignored and was looking at said had gone back and looked at the investigative steps taken as accelerated he continued had done that but unlike and he had no access to the the and the foreign governments that were involved facilitate what later became a criminal investigation ordered the heads of the intelligence agencies to cooperate with delegated to the power to order the declassification of secret documents has spoken with intelligence officials from and to reportedly solicit information that could help the case of where and met with political leaders and intelligence chiefs in person his visit provoked concern among diplomats who told that circumvented protocols in setting up the trip of who is the ranking on the and helped write its five-volume report said there were about s trips he said a former colleague of s from the years said he thought could come back with something more s investigation he told me s investigation is not the only means through which s decisions could affect the election the wants to open a criminal investigation into either campaign it will first need s personal approval has established a special to deal with materials that says he has obtained from sources which has claimed implicate the presumptive presidential nominee the interview did not dispute the notion that the government had interfered in 2016 but he made it sound as though the assumption that it favored would be coming under some pressure also would expect to play a role in deterring and punishing foreign interference in the 2020 election but that could get complicated s camp continues to deny the intelligence community s consensus view one strongly reiterated by and the intelligence committee that the favored over including on the claim to have unreleased evidence that points the other way on what told me intentions will most likely emerge as the key retrospective battlegrounds as s work continues and the election draws closer said what did not address directly was the fourth volume of the report from the intelligence committee report reviewed much of the same intelligence underlying the affirmed that s pro-Trump position and s direct involvement were supported by s disagreement was the committee s groundbreaking 2012 the fourth volume was unanimously approved by a bipartisan vote of the committee said a from and the chairman of the committee for his part dismissed s investigation as he told me brought up the investigation again in my last interview with on 20 fifth floor of headquarters now felt different some older lawyerly looking men walking around wore masks younger men in suits with lapel pins who were most likely security did not himself still wore no mask but there were no more polite entreaties for visitors to take theirs off could see two crumpled blue surgical masks lying amid the papers on s desk disarming familiarity sat down on a sofa and offered me my in a tufted leather chair then had seized on the meme accusing the former president and of asked what crime he thought they were guilty of declined to answer a news conference two days before went to see him was asked indirectly if s investigation might lead to criminal charges being filed against or he said that same day asked about s statement replied went on then said he had that and were in what he now called a to whether or not it was criminal he said s office two days later brought up how seemed to have heard only what he wanted to hear that s prediction about not prosecuting the former president was only valid said shouldn t read too much into those words he said he realized it or not the line had drawn at the news conference was getting blurrier with every word just as had hoped went on pulled back from the conversation and thought for a moment keeping tabs on s investigation for more than a year did not think it was likely that he would have to prosecute a former president neither at that moment was he willing to rule it out made this position sound reasonable even as it served to support the unsupported theory that the president was floating at the time the end the substance of s findings might not matter he turns up will become a major theme of s 2020 campaign the less time there is before an election the greater political impact of even the smallest apparent revelation needed from was the glimmer of a possibility a slight shadow of official uncertainty in which his wild theories could flourish for now was giving him that much more he would give the president before it was hard to say'"
