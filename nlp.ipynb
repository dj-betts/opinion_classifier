crucial legacy of 2016 is that the question of  legitimacy was never settled  without any consensus on what happened in 2016 the rules of the road for 2020 are up in the air  first armed with the

 findings beginning to take shape  governments conduct during the  transition  has said was  of  campaign amounted to  there was the all-important question of whether the    was justified in opening

both  and  decided to do just that     s interest in   said was based and  said in his own statement  had found that the investigation was justified so these sounded like sweeping words of dissent  over the coming months as attention drifted elsewhere they shrank  the time  sat down with  the only dispute with  hed voiced was whether the    had enough evidence to open a full investigation  and  believe that there was only enough to open a preliminary investigation not a full one  our first interview  mentioned the dossier of salacious anti-Trump claims that had been gathered and circulated by   a former  intelligence agent who was working indirectly for the  campaign  possibility that the  government intentionally seeded the dossier with misinformation was one of the issues  ignored and  was looking at  said  had  gone back and looked at the investigative steps taken as   accelerated he continued  had done that but unlike  and  he had no access to the    the    and the foreign

to deal with materials that    says he has obtained from  sources which  has claimed implicate   the presumptive  presidential nominee  the interview  did not dispute the notion that the  government had interfered in 2016 but he made it sound as though the assumption that it favored  would be coming under some pressure  also would expect  to play a role in deterring and punishing foreign interference in the 2020 election but that could get complicated  camp continues to deny the intelligence communitys consensus view one strongly reiterated by  and the  intelligence committee that the

continues and the election draws closer  said  what  did not address directly was the fourth volume of the report from the  intelligence committee  report reviewed much of the same intelligence

declined to answer  a news conference two days before  went to see him  was asked indirectly if  investigation might lead to criminal charges being filed against  or  he said  that same day  asked about  statement replied  went on  then said he had that  and  were in what he now called a  to whether or not it was criminal he said   office two days later  brought up how  seemed to have heard only what he wanted to hear that  prediction about not prosecuting the former president was only valid  said  shouldnt read too much into those words he said  he realized it or not the line  had drawn at the news conference was getting blurrier with every word just as  had hoped  went on  pulled back from the conversation and thought for a moment  keeping tabs on  investigation for more than a year  did not think it was likely that he would have to prosecute a former president  neither at that moment was he willing to rule it out  made this position sound reasonable even as it served to support the unsupported theory that the president was floating at the time  the end the substance of  findings might not matter  he turns up will become a major theme of  2020 campaign the less time there is before an election the greater political impact of even the smallest apparent revelation   needed from  was the glimmer of a possibility a slight shadow of official uncertainty in which his wild theories could flourish  for now  was giving him that  much more he would give the president before  it was hard to say'"

sometimes described as an adjective that also captures his professorial manner  speaking voice is very soft just loud enough to be consistently perceptible his accent is patrician with a trace of old    personality breaks through mostly in frequent moments of humor which range from clubby chuckles to tension-breaking eruptions an aide added  crossed the circle of chairs grinning away any awkwardness  bumped elbows he said in the same joshing tone  greater risk of course was that  might infect him given his cabinet-level access to regular coronavirus testing the difference in our ages  regular meetings with the president and the mostly one-way prophylactic value of masks in general his aide suggested again  took it off   the whole country was doing the same dance   for   and  had recommended that all  wear masks at meetings like this one   was doing something else and so for the time being was the   staff     having been wrong-footed after taking the no-mask custom to the

document predicting that the number of daily deaths would rise into   reckless faith of the presidents inner circle would be challenged when two members of the   staff tested positive for the

on  3  has to assume that  is keeping a close eye on the 70-year-old  right now  powers of the attorney general as the executive branchs rule interpreter and law enforcer peak during moments of social

during an arrest in 2014  role also gives him influence over three major political fronts heading into   there is  fight to open the nations economy which could depend in no small part on  interpretation of federal authority and willingness to twist governors arms  there are the mechanics of the vote itself a topic of great partisan controversy about which the   has shown a growing willingness to weigh in  there is the ongoing investigation led by   the   attorney in  into the origins of the    s  probe in the run-up to the 2016 election the findings of which are widely expected to be announced before   the election now on the horizon  defended his record in two recent interviews  critics charge that since becoming attorney general he has repeatedly steered the   toward decisions that serve  interests particularly around the investigations carried out by the    and     into  influence over the 2016 election  insists that he acts independently even as the president often undermines that claim by tweeting out apparent instructions for what his attorney general ought to do  the time of our first meeting in his office  had already started looking at how the federal government might intervene in state-ordered coronavirus shutdowns   accused  governors of denying citizens their and encouraged residents to   and   zeroed in on the nuts and bolts of the legal case for  two small churches filed lawsuits seeking to hold live services despite state or local regulations the   made filings in support of their   rights  a signed memorandum sent to the departments 93   attorneys  suggested that the federal governments interest went beyond protecting live worship  included  weeks before our interview  bragged that he held authority over the states  went against the prevailing view that the federal government while free to enforce a variety of measures during its own emergencies is more constrained in its authority to compel state or local governments to lift theirs   asked  what  meant he responded by laying out a general view of the presidents pandemic-related powers he said  answer sounded so dry and routine that  failed to ask what he meant by  broadly enough  interpretation could sanitize and legalize  claim to authority  ballots are another domain where  had been staking out turf  called the distribution of ballot applications in  and warned that voting by mail  a second interview on  20 when  asked who was going to referee the 2020 election  replied  said his departments role would be limited as the power belongs to the states and their electors  when  brought up  tweet about  which he posted that same morning  quickly seized the opportunity to float a new theory that foreign governments might conspire to mail in fake ballots he cautioned offering no evidence to substantiate that this was a real possibility  he called it and added  many election-related issues the  of  has to defer to the states  in the case of  investigation

me was looking for  paused glanced down and fidgeted for a moment with his necktie before going on  seems aware at times that he is gambling with his reputation he said with a matter-of-fact sigh in a  interview last year  we spoke in his office he was critical of what he called  tendency to around himself he said he added  willingness to weather controversy on the presidents behalf has not only caused consternation among some former friends and allies it has given rise to considerable speculation about his motives  would a grandfather in semiretirement who had already reached the pinnacle of his profession sign up for this  wonder if  might still be hungry for influence having been attorney general for only 17 months the first time  wonder whether he spent too much time watching   during the  years and came out the other side an ideologue  there are others who look at  support for  and see more consistency than contradiction  they say hasnt changed his values  he has found in  the perfect vehicle with which to move them forward says   who led the   civil division during  first tour and then succeeded him serving as acting attorney general during the first three months of   presidency  far as what  is hoping to do with his canvas  says he is committed to the and premise that  isnt too far away from what  himself articulated in a 2019 speech at the  of     view piety lay
