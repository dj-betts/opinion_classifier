believe that there was only enough to open a preliminary investigation not a full one  our first interview  mentioned the dossier of salacious anti-Trump claims that had been gathered and circulated

 did not think it was likely that he would have to prosecute a former president  neither at that moment was he willing to rule it out  made this position sound reasonable even as it served to support
