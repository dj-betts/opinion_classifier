 findings beginning to take shape  governments conduct during the  transition  has said was  of  campaign amounted to  there was the all-important question of whether the    was justified in opening

both  and  decided to do just that     s interest in   said was based and  said in his own statement  had found that the investigation was justified so these sounded like sweeping words of dissent  over the coming months as attention drifted elsewhere they shrank  the time  sat down with  the only dispute with  hed voiced was whether the    had enough evidence to open a full investigation  and  believe that there was only enough to open a preliminary investigation not a full one  our first interview  mentioned the dossier of salacious anti-Trump claims that had been gathered and circulated by   a former  intelligence agent who was working indirectly for the  campaign  possibility that the  government intentionally seeded the dossier with misinformation was one of the issues  ignored and  was looking at  said  had  gone back and looked at the investigative steps taken as   accelerated he continued  had done that but unlike  and  he had no access to the    the    and the foreign

to deal with materials that    says he has obtained from  sources which  has claimed implicate   the presumptive  presidential nominee  the interview  did not dispute the notion that the  government had interfered in 2016 but he made it sound as though the assumption that it favored  would be coming under some pressure  also would expect  to play a role in deterring and punishing foreign interference in the 2020 election but that could get complicated  camp continues to deny the intelligence communitys consensus view one strongly reiterated by  and the  intelligence committee that the

declined to answer  a news conference two days before  went to see him  was asked indirectly if  investigation might lead to criminal charges being filed against  or  he said  that same day  asked about  statement replied  went on  then said he had that  and  were in what he now called a  to whether or not it was criminal he said   office two days later  brought up how  seemed to have heard only what he wanted to hear that  prediction about not prosecuting the former president was only valid  said  shouldnt read too much into those words he said  he realized it or not the line  had drawn at the news conference was getting blurrier with every word just as  had hoped  went on  pulled back from the conversation and thought for a moment  keeping tabs on  investigation for more than a year  did not think it was likely that he would have to prosecute a former president  neither at that moment was he willing to rule it out  made this position sound reasonable even as it served to support the unsupported theory that the president was floating at the time  the end the substance of  findings might not matter  he turns up will become a major theme of  2020 campaign the less time there is before an election the greater political impact of even the smallest apparent revelation   needed from  was the glimmer of a possibility a slight shadow of official uncertainty in which his wild theories could flourish  for now  was giving him that  much more he would give the president before  it was hard to say'"
